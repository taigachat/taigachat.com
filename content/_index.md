# Mission
The mission of TaigaChat is to create a platform where users can easily & safely communicate with large
groups of people, colloquially known as an online community.
For an online community to work in the long term sustainably, the community must be able to control all
aspects of its community. The current unfortunate status quo is that online tech giants are able
to control, everything. Leaving very little up to the individual to decide. TaigaChat seeks to remedy this
situation by giving back control.

# Introducing TaigaChat
In TaigaChat, tyrrany is impossible. We as the creators are:
1. Unable to censor your community
2. Unable to globally ban users or lock accounts
3. Unable to eaves-drop on communities
4. Unable to sell your data
5. Unable to disable your encryption

If you are familiar with the freedoms of E-Mail, this will all seem very familiar!

_(Please note that for 3 & 4 to be guaranteed, your community must self-host)_
